    "where $R$ is the measure of curvature, $r$ is the radius of a circle where the center and the points of the circle are on the surface being measured, and $C$ is the circumference of the circle as measured by line integral on the surface. The factor of 6 is apparently some convenient normalization constant we'll be happy to have later, but I don't understand the presence of $r^2$ in the denominator. $R$ vanishes everywhere for a surface with extrinsic curvature or a flat surface, but is non-zero for a surface with intrinsic curvature."
