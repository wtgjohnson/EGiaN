    "This confused me a bit. It was easy enough to see how $a' = a + du/dt$ is obtained from $v' = v + u$ if $u$ is a function of $t$, but don't we need to start with $x' = x + ut$? Let's take a look at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x' = x + ut$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't use the above equation anymore. It defines constant velocity. Let's define constant acceleration instead.\n",

    "$$x' = x + ut + \\frac{bt^2}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first equation is constant velocity because for every unit of time passed, $u$ units of distance are added to $x$. This linear progression gives a constant additive to the velocity of $u$, $v'=v+u$, as shown in the text by taking the derviative with respect to $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second equation describes a constant acceleration of $b$ (with an initial constant velocity of $u$). To see why let's take the derivative of the equation with respect to $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx'}{dt}=\\frac{dx}{dt}+\\frac{du}{dt}t+u+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{db}{dt}t^2+bt$$\n",

    "which is the same as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v'=v+u+bt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $db/dt=0$ because this scenario has constant acceleration and $du/dt=0$ because $u$ is not a function of time. It is a parameter that describes the initial relative velocity of Ms. Unprime and Mr. Prime. $u$ is constant in this scenario just as it was before. However, $v'$ is not constant and the updated equation of motion shows that. At time $t=0$, $v'=v+u$. The constant $u$ has been added to the initial velocity of $v$ to obtain $v'$.\n",

    "We've added a constant acceleration of $b$ to conveyance of Mr. Prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "My confusion I think stemmed from the comment \"In deriving $a'=a$, we used $\\frac{du}{dt}=0$, but if that were not so, we would have $a'=a+\\frac{du}{dt}$.\" If you define the $u$ of the second scenario, $u_2$, as $u_2=u+bt$, then the text makes sense and the text's $ma'=ma+m\\frac{du}{dt}$ is the same as $ma'=ma+mb$.\n",
