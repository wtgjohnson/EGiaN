Parallax observes the moon's location relative to a distant star at two locations of known distance $d$ from each other at the same time. The process is made simpler by choosing two locations on the same meridian. Afterwards, the two observers compare notes and the difference bewteen their observation angles can be used in a trigonometric relationship to obtain R_{Moon}\n",

The difference in separate causes a difference in apparent size of the Moon. The Moon when directly overhead is measurably larger. One measurement [obtained by an observer posted on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTtce3rJxhc) showed that the Moon is 1.2% larger. He was in Los Angelese at a latitude of 34 degrees which means that 1.2% corresponds to a difference in the distance of 0.64 $R_{Earth}$."
